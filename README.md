# Predictive-Analysis-Techniques-to-Identify-Risk-Factors-Associated-with-Obesity---Final-Results

Inroduction to the study: 
The study used the data science method on the historical dataset "Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition (2019)" from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository to a) identify the risk factors associated with obesity and b) recognize the best machine learning model that can produce the best results in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and stability.
EDA Report: Following the data science process, panda profiling is used to generate an exploratory data analysis report
